Generating Art Images with StyleGAN and Spectral Normalization
This repository contains code for generating art images using StyleGAN and Spectral Normalization, applied to the "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" Kaggle challenge dataset.

# Introduction
This project uses the StyleGAN and Spectral Normalization techniques to generate new art images based on the dataset from the "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" Kaggle challenge. StyleGAN is a popular technique for generating high-quality images with realistic details, while Spectral Normalization helps to stabilize the training process and improve the quality of the generated images.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
# Conclusion
In this project, we have shown how to use StyleGAN and Spectral Normalization to generate art images from the "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" Kaggle challenge dataset. With these techniques, we can create high-quality, realistic images that capture the unique style and beauty of the original artworks.
